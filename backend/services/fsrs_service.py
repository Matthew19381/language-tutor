"""
FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) Service.

Replaces the legacy SM-2 algorithm with FSRS v6, a modern spaced repetition
algorithm based on the DSR (Difficulty, Stability, Retrievability) model.

Uses the `fsrs` Python package (v6.x) which implements the FSRS-6 algorithm.

Rating scale (unified 1-4, same as Anki):
  1 = Again  (forgot completely)
  2 = Hard   (recalled with significant difficulty)
  3 = Good   (recalled with some effort)
  4 = Easy   (instant, effortless recall)

Both flashcards and topics use this same 1-4 scale for consistency.
